## Acknowledgments

We thank the 60 undergraduate engineering students who participated in this study and generously shared their learning experiences through assessments and surveys. We acknowledge the teaching assistants who supported VR equipment rotation and project evaluation. We are grateful to NMIMS MPSTME for providing institutional support, classroom facilities, and access to Oculus Quest 2 headsets. We also thank the technical support team for maintaining Unity development environments and managing device logistics.

## Data Availability Statement

The datasets analyzed in this study, including anonymized student assessment data, project rubric scores, and collaboration survey responses, along with all Python analysis code and YAML-formatted assessment instruments, are available via GitHub: https://github.com/sunny-nanade/xr-education-cross-disciplinary-teams

Repository contents include:
- Anonymized participant data (CSV)
- Python analysis code (team formation and statistical analysis)
- Assessment instruments (pre/post test, project rubric, collaboration survey in YAML)
- Publication-ready tables (CSV + LaTeX) and figures (PNG, 300 dpi)
- A comprehensive replication guide

Data and code are licensed under MIT. Questions can be directed to the corresponding author at sunny.nanade@nmims.edu. To protect student privacy, the publicly shared version uses anonymized student identifiers (e.g., ST001–ST060); the file mapping identifiers to student names is retained securely by the authors for verification and auditing purposes only.

## Ethics Statement

This study was conducted in accordance with ethical principles for educational research involving human participants and NMIMS institutional policies. The study was conducted as part of regular course activities with minimal risk to participants (IRB documentation to be provided during peer review).

Informed consent was obtained via Google Forms during Week 1 after full disclosure of study purposes, procedures, data collection methods, confidentiality measures, and the right to withdraw at any time without academic penalty. The consent form included a clear statement that participation was voluntary, would not affect course grades or academic standing, and that non-participants would receive identical instruction and assessment. All students provided digital consent before any research data collection began.Data confidentiality was maintained through: (1) assignment of anonymized identifiers to replace names in all datasets, (2) secure storage of consent forms and identifier mapping files in locked institutional servers accessible only to the research team, (3) aggregated reporting of results with no individual student performance disclosed, and (4) destruction of raw identifiable data five years post-publication per institutional policy.

- Python scripts for team formation and statistical analysis
- Extended statistical tables (full descriptive statistics, correlation matrices)
- Comprehensive replication guide with step-by-step instructions

All materials are available in the GitHub repository referenced in the Data Availability Statement.
